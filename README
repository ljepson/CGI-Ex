NAME
    CGI::Ex - CGI utility suite (form getter/filler/validator/app builder)

SYNOPSIS
      ### CGI Module Extensions

      my $cgix = CGI::Ex->new;
      my $hashref = $cgix->get_form; # uses CGI by default

      ### send the Content-type header - whether or not we are mod_perl
      $cgix->print_content_type;

      my $val_hash = $cgix->conf_read($pathtovalidation);

      my $err_obj = $cgix->validate($hashref, $val_hash);
      if ($err_obj) {
        my $errors  = $err_obj->as_hash;
        my $input   = "Some content";
        my $content = "";
        SomeTemplateObject->process($input, $errors, $content);
        $cgix->fill({text => \$content, form => $hashref});
        print $content;
        exit;
      }

      print "Success\n";

      ### Filling functionality

      $cgix->fill({text => \$text, form    => \%hash});
      $cgix->fill({text => \$text, fdat    => \%hash});
      $cgix->fill({text => \$text, fobject => $cgiobject});
      $cgix->fill({text => \$text, form    => [\%hash1, $cgiobject]});
      $cgix->fill({text => \$text); # uses $self->object as the form
      $cgix->fill({text          => \$text,
                     form          => \%hash,
                     target        => 'formname',
                     fill_password => 0,
                     ignore_fields => ['one','two']});
      $cgix->fill(\$text); # uses $self->object as the form
      $cgix->fill(\$text, \%hash, 'formname', 0, ['one','two']);
      my $copy = $cgix->fill({scalarref => \$text,    fdat => \%hash});
      my $copy = $cgix->fill({arrayref  => \@lines,   fdat => \%hash});
      my $copy = $cgix->fill({file      => $filename, fdat => \%hash});

      ### Validation functionality

      my $err_obj = $cgix->validate($form, $val_hash);
      my $err_obj = $cgix->validate($form, $path_to_validation);
      my $err_obj = $cgix->validate($form, $yaml_string);

      ### get errors separated by key name
      ### useful for inline errors
      my $hash = $err_obj->as_hash;
      my %hash = $err_obj->as_hash;

      ### get aggregate list of errors
      ### useful for central error description
      my $array = $err_obj->as_array;
      my @array = $err_obj->as_array;

      ### get a string
      ### useful for central error description
      my $string = $err_obj->as_string;
      my $string = "$err_obj";

      $cgix->{raise_error} = 1;
      $cgix->validate($form, $val_hash);
        # SAME AS #
      my $err_obj = $cgix->validate($form, $val_hash);
      die $err_obj if $err_obj;

      ### Settings functionality

      ### read file via yaml
      my $ref = $cgix->conf_read('/full/path/to/conf.yaml');

      ### merge all found settings.pl files together
      @CGI::Ex::Conf::DEFAULT_PATHS = qw(/tmp /my/data/dir /home/foo);
      @CGI::Ex::Conf::DIRECTIVE     = 'MERGE';
      @CGI::Ex::Conf::DEFAULT_EXT   = 'pl';
      my $ref = $cgix->conf_read('settings');

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Ex provides a suite of utilities to make writing CGI scripts more
    enjoyable. Although they can all be used separately, the main
    functionality of each of the modules is best represented in the
    CGI::Ex::App module. CGI::Ex::App takes CGI application building to the
    next step. CGI::Ex::App is not a framework (which normally includes
    prebuilt html) instead CGI::Ex::App is an extended application flow that
    normally dramatically reduces CGI build time. See CGI::Ex::App.

    CGI::Ex is another form filler / validator / conf reader / template
    interface. Its goal is to take the wide scope of validators and other
    useful CGI application modules out there and merge them into one utility
    that has all of the necessary features of them all, as well as several
    extended methods that I have found useful in working on the web.

    The main functionality is provided by several other modules that may be
    used separately, or together through the CGI::Ex interface.

    "CGI::Ex::Fill"
        A regular expression based form filler inner (accessed through
        ->fill or directly via its own functions). Can be a drop in
        replacement for HTML::FillInForm. See CGI::Ex::Fill for more
        information.

    "CGI::Ex::Validate"
        A form field / cgi parameter / any parameter validator (accessed
        through ->validate or directly via its own methods). Not quite a
        drop in for most validators, although it has most of the
        functionality of most of the validators but with the key additions
        of conditional validation. Has a tightly integrated JavaScript
        portion that allows for duplicate client side validation. See
        CGI::Ex::Validate for more information.

    "CGI::Ex::Conf"
        A general use configuration, or settings, or key / value file
        reader. Has ability for providing key fallback as well as immutable
        key definitions. Has default support for yaml, storable, perl, ini,
        and xml and open architecture for definition of others. See
        CGI::Ex::Conf for more information.

METHODS
    "->fill"
        fill is used for filling hash or cgi object values into an existing
        html document (it doesn't deal at all with how you got the
        document). Arguments may be given as a hash, or a hashref or
        positional. Some of the following arguments will only work using
        CGI::Ex::Fill - most will work with either CGI::Ex::Fill or
        HTML::FillInForm (assume they are available unless specified
        otherwise). (See CGI::Ex::Fill for a full explanation of
        functionality). The arguments to fill are as follows (and in order
        of position):

        "text"
            Text should be a reference to a scalar string containing the
            html to be modified (actually it could be any reference or
            object reference that can be modfied as a string). It will be
            modified in place. Another named argument scalarref is available
            if you would like to copy rather than modify.

        "form"
            Form may be a hashref, a cgi style object, a coderef, or an
            array of multiple hashrefs, cgi objects, and coderefs. Hashes
            should be key value pairs. CGI objects should be able to call
            the method param (This can be overrided). Coderefs should expect
            expect the field name as an argument and should return a value.
            Values returned by form may be undef, scalar, arrayref, or
            coderef (coderef values should expect an argument of field name
            and should return a value). The code ref options are available
            to delay or add options to the bringing in of form informatin -
            without having to tie the hash. Coderefs are not available in
            HTML::FillInForm. Also HTML::FillInForm only allows CGI objects
            if an arrayref is used.

            NOTE: Only one of the form, fdat, and fobject arguments are
            allowed at a time.

        "target"
            The name of the form that the fields should be filled to. The
            default value of undef, means to fill in all forms in the html.

        "fill_passwords"
            Boolean value defaults to 1. If set to zero - password fields
            will not be filled.

        "ignore_fields"
            Specify which fields to not fill in. It takes either array ref
            of names, or a hashref with the names as keys. The hashref
            option is not available in CGI::Ex::Fill.

        Other named arguments are available for compatiblity with
        HTML::FillInForm. They may only be used as named arguments.

        "scalarref"
            Almost the same as the argument text. If scalarref is used, the
            filled html will be returned. If text is used the html passed is
            filled in place.

        "arrayref"
            An array ref of lines of the document. Forces a returned filled
            html document.

        "file"
            An filename that will be opened, filled, and returned.

        "fdat"
            A hashref of key value pairs.

        "fobject"
            A cgi style object or arrayref of cgi style objects used for
            getting the key value pairs. Should be capable of the ->param
            method and ->cookie method as document in CGI.

        See CGI::Ex::Fill for more information about the filling process.

    "->object"
        Returns the CGI object that is currently being used by CGI::Ex. If
        none has been set it will automatically generate an object of type
        $PREFERRED_CGI_MODULE which defaults to CGI.

    "->validate"
        Validate has a wide range of options available. (See
        CGI::Ex::Validate for a full explanation of functionality). Validate
        has two arguments:

        "form"
            Can be either a hashref to be validated, or a CGI style object
            (which has the param method).

        "val_hash"
            The val_hash can be one of three items. First, it can be a
            straight perl hashref containing the validation to be done.
            Second, it can be a YAML document string. Third, it can be the
            path to a file containing the validation. The validation in a
            validation file will be read in depending upon file extension.

    "->get_form"
        Very similar to CGI->new->Vars except that arrays are returned as
        arrays. Not sure why CGI::Val didn't do this anyway (well - yes -
        legacy Perl 4 - but at some point things need to be updated).

    "->set_form"
        Allow for setting a custom form hash. Useful for testing, or other
        purposes.

    "->get_cookies"
        Returns a hash of all cookies.

    "->make_form"
        Takes a hash and returns a query_string. A second optional argument
        may contain an arrayref of keys to use from the hash in building the
        query_string. First argument is undef, it will use the form stored
        in itself as the hash.

    "->content_type"
        Can be called multiple times during the same session. Will only
        print content-type once. (Useful if you don't know if something else
        already printed content-type). Calling this sends the Content-type
        header. Trying to print ->content_type is an error. For clarity, the
        method ->print_content_type is available.

    "->set_cookie"
        Arguments are the same as those to CGI->new->cookie({}). Uses CGI's
        cookie method to create a cookie, but then, depending on if content
        has already been sent to the browser will either print a Set-cookie
        header, or will add a <meta http-equiv='set-cookie'> tag (this is
        supported on most major browsers). This is useful if you don't know
        if something else already printed content-type.

    "->location_bounce"
        Depending on if content has already been sent to the browser will
        either print a Location header, or will add a <meta
        http-equiv='refresh'> tag (this is supported on all major browsers).
        This is useful if you don't know if something else already printed
        content-type. Takes single argument of a url.

    "->last_modified"
        Depending on if content has already been sent to the browser will
        either print a Last-Modified header, or will add a <meta
        http-equiv='Last-Modified'> tag (this is supported on most major
        browsers). This is useful if you don't know if something else
        already printed content-type. Takes an argument of either a time
        (may be a CGI -expires style time) or a filename.

    "->expires"
        Depending on if content has already been sent to the browser will
        either print a Expires header, or will add a <meta
        http-equiv='Expires'> tag (this is supported on most major
        browsers). This is useful if you don't know if something else
        already printed content-type. Takes an argument of a time (may be a
        CGI -expires style time).

    "->send_status"
        Send a custom status. Works in both CGI and mod_perl. Arguments are
        a status code and the content (optional).

    "->send_header"
        Send a http header. Works in both CGI and mod_perl. Arguments are a
        header name and the value for that header.

    "->print_js"
        Prints out a javascript file. Does everything it can to make sure
        that the javascript will cache. Takes either a full filename, or a
        shortened name which will be looked for in @INC. (ie
        /full/path/to/my.js or CGI/Ex/validate.js or CGI::Ex::validate)

    "->swap_template"
        This is intended as a simple yet strong subroutine to swap in tags
        to a document. It is intended to be very basic for those who may not
        want the full features of a Templating system such as
        Template::Toolkit (even though they should investigate them because
        they are pretty nice). The default allows for basic template toolkit
        variable swapping. There are two arguments. First is a string or a
        reference to a string. If a string is passed, a copy of that string
        is swapped and returned. If a reference to a string is passed, it is
        modified in place. The second argument is a form, or a CGI object,
        or a cgiex object, or a coderef (if the second argument is missing,
        the cgiex object which called the method will be used). If it is a
        coderef, it should accept key as its only argument and return the
        proper value.

          my $cgix = CGI::Ex->new;
          my $form = {foo  => 'bar',
                      this => {is => {nested => ['wow', 'wee']}}
                     };

          my $str =  $cgix->swap_template("<html>[% foo %]<br>[% foo %]</html>", $form));
          # $str eq '<html>bar<br>bar</html>'

          $str = $cgix->swap_template("[% this.is.nested.1 %]", $form));
          # $str eq 'wee'

          $str = "[% this.is.nested.0 %]";
          $cgix->swap_template(\$str, $form);
          # $str eq 'wow'

          # may also be called with only one argument as follows:
          # assuming $cgix had a query string of ?foo=bar&baz=wow&this=wee
          $str = "<html>([% foo %]) <br>
                  ([% baz %]) <br>
                  ([% this %]) </html>";
          $cgix->swap_template(\$str);
          #$str eq "<html>(bar) <br>
          #        (wow) <br>
          #        (wee) </html>";
  
        For further examples, please see the code contained in
        t/samples/cgi_ex_* of this distribution.

        If at a later date, the developer upgrades to Template::Toolkit, the
        templates that were being swapped by CGI::Ex::swap_template should
        be compatible with Template::Toolkit.
